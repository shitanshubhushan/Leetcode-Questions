Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

class Solution {
public:
    int diameter=0;
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        traverse(root);
        return diameter;
    }
    int traverse(TreeNode* curr){
        if(curr==nullptr)
            return 0;
        int left=traverse(curr->left);
        int right=traverse(curr->right);
        diameter=max(diameter,left+right);
        
        return max(left,right)+1;
    }
};
